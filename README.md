# text_encryption_decryption_system

This is a simple gui application named 'text_encryption_decryption_system'. 
It is only for customize personal security purposes.
I have done this project in two ways. One is in a single window and another one is in dual window.
The function of this project is too easy to understand. You just have to enter your message and it will return you a secret message of code and it can be customize with your own choice. And it can be used as vice versa, it means there is a another option to decode your secret code to get back the original message.

## Here is a demo for this project [Single Window]

## Here is the new version of this project

In this version I have added two new feature. One is a 'Browse' option to access any kind of file (basically you need to a text file) accrording to your pc and make it executable with encryption decryption system, no matter how long it is! And another is 'save' option to save your encoded or decoded file.

### Here is the demo.
